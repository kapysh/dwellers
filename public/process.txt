process for dwellers

!step 1 - 
	refactoring:
		deleted the 3 line section before the chuteLoop definition

!step 2 - 
	fixed z-index's
		0 - body, #container
		5 - chute_container, chute_container:hover
		1000 - header, section, form
	also added pointer-events:none to some elements overlapping the parachutes
		so that i didn't have to shiv an element under the logo and get rid of the padding	

!step 3 - 
	set a limit on the number of possible parachutes - to stop the browswer from crashing

!step 4 - implement parachute destruction sequence

!step 5 - submit button initiates mass parachute destruction sequence

step 6 - second tag bounces up on page load 

!step 7 - make the parachutes paths less linear
	added css3 keyframe transitions to move the parachutes left to right
	had to subtract 10 from the random position chosen for the spawned parachute in .js
	had to link fix.js to clean up animation easing

step 8 - fancify button

?step 9 - get mc-success positioning working for firefox
	get anything to work on IE
	sometimes jquery stutters

step 10 - implement modernizr

!step 11 - make parachutes draggable
